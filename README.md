What to expect

  Lost in the "Maison du Savoir" Belval building at the Univesity of Luxembourg? Cannot find your classroom? Already late for your lesson and don't know which way to run to find classroom 3100?

  Let's face it, there is no logic in how they labelled classrooms at "Maison du Savoir" and you just waste your time looking at the numbers on the walls.

  RooMapp is an app helping students find their lessons faster on the third foor of "Maison du Savoir". It gives you an opportunity to enter your courses and classrooms for the whole semester. We will give you a map and guide you to each classroom. 
  
  the app also has pictures of each classroom, so you know what to expect when you get there. Is your lesson in a small room or in a big lecture hall? Also, if you have to give a presentation, you can check which cables or wireless solutions are available in each room for you to connect your computer once you get there.

Collaborators

  This project was done within a course 'Software Engineering Project' at the University of Luxembourg (IT Studies). It was made by Jim Kemp, Roy Steinmetzer and Helene Reisner.
